    $ dfs.exe <file_name>
    - Ex: dfs.exe G-6-6.txt

> Output
    - The output consists of the adjacency list follow by:
        . For each dfs iteration:
            > Current Discovery list
            > Current Closing list
            > Current Predecessors list
            > Current Colors list
