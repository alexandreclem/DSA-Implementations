> Breadth First Search Implementation in C
    
> Input
    - Are given 3 data files in the format:
        . G-<Number of Vertices>-<Number of Edges>.txt

> Compiling the code:
    $ gcc bfs.c -o bfs

> Executing:
    $ bfs.exe <file_name>
    - Ex: bfs.exe G-6-6.txt

> Output
    - The output consists of the adjacency list follow by:
        . For each bfs iteration:
            > Current Queue 
            > Current Colors list
            > Current Distances list
            > Current Predecessors list

* Note: The program uses the vertices from 0 to n - 1
